# crudProject


crudProject, AKA Shruti Arora Photography, is an individual project designed and created by Chris Buttaro.  
After learning Spring MVC this week, we were asked to create a web application capable
of creating, reading, updating, and destroying objects. I decided to create "Photo" objects which include 
image sources and widths as attributes so that my wife could have a place to showcase her photography.  
In Order to do so I have to add the functionality of writing back to a file in addition to the CRUD capabilities. 
Also in addition to the criteria of creating a CRUD application, I implemented an index page with an option to login.  
If you have a password you can login as an administrator and edit the image list.  If you do not, I added a link which 
loads the application so that all the images can be viewed in a read only context. 


The technologies utilized to build the application were:
Java
Spring MVC
HTML and CSS 
Bootstrap


This project is still very much in the making for me. I would like to update the aesthetics of the application to 
include better looking foward and back buttons, smoother page transitions, an updated logo, and a horizontal list 
of small image links at the bottom of each page so the user can jump to any image in the list.
